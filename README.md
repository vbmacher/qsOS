Quick Simple Operating System (QSOS)
====================================

This is my (very old) attempt to create an operating system.

It is actually very simple kernel written in x86 assembly and C. In order to run it, it must be stored on 3,5" floppy disk.
It uses custom file system (QFS). The system can run COM programs and allows to chat with single person through RS-232.

It is the result of my learning of assembly and C in the past (1999-2005).


Prerequisities:
---------------

- Borland C++ 3.1
- Turbo Assembler 3.0
