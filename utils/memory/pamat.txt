INT 15 - SYSTEM - later PS/2s - RETURN MEMORY-MAP INFORMATION
	AH = C7h
	DS:SI -> user supplied memory map table (see #00526)
Return: CF set on error
	CF clear if successful
Notes:	call AH=C0h and examine bit 4 of feature byte 2 to check if this
	  function is supported
	IBM classifies this function as optional
	Windows95 OSR2 reportedly does not support this function even though
	  INT 15/AH=C0h indicates that it is available (observed on several
	  different systems)
